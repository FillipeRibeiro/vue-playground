# Vue Playground

This repository represents small projects just to learn the basics of Vue.js.
## Setup and Run
All of them have the same setup and run instructions.
To run any of those projects is mandatory have NODE.JS installed. See the official documentation https://nodejs.org/en/.

### *Install dependencies and run project*
In the project's root run the command `npm install`.
After that run `npm run serve` to star application on localhost. Vue.js uses the url *http://localhost:8080* as a standard.
